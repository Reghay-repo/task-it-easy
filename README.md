# Task it easy

A offline-first task management app. The readme **still not finished**, if you want to know more details go to the [Task it easy about page](https://task-it-easy-beta.netlify.app/about/get-started/the-project).

#### ü§î **Why build yet another task management app?**

Many online tools out there offer a good amount of features and user experience before the paywall. However, the fact that they are server-first just doesn't feel right.

That's why I decided to start Task it Easy, an offline-first task management app that is totally free, anonymous, and open-source. This app has three fundamental directions:

-   Offline-first
-   JSON format
-   Make it extensible

The inpiration is Obsidian.md a note-taking app that have similar goals. The experience of using Obsidian for task management feels also wrong because it's primerly a note-taking app, so all plugins made feels not optimal for this specific solution and task it easy also aims to provide an interface for colaborative work.

#### üí° How it works

Task it easy primerely works using the IndexedDB API to persist and serach data on the user browser, it can also export data to a `JSON` file or even integrate with `Google Sheets` to store and get your data.

```diff
- Deleting your browser data also deletes taskt it easy data.
```

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Future

This session is dedicated to elaborate future features of task it easy

##### **1. Desktop and mobile version**

A native vesion can improve the accessibility, user experience and the productvity.

##### **2. Task it easy server**

A possible solution for sharing data is to have your own server. An easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) application that runs a server in the background and stores and serves data using endpoints could be a good idea. The implementation can be done in various programming languages and can have different approaches, as long as it implements all the necessary endpoints.

##### **3. Teams**

Some web-based task/project management services charge every member of a team to use their infrastructure. However, using a common server for everyone can be more cost-effective and efficient.

##### **4. Shared spaces**

Sometimes, you may need to share your space with someone. This can be made possible with a server.

##### **5. Natural Processing Language for create tasks**

Creating tasks is still easy, but it would be more pleasant to simply write something like "Check this every Sunday" and have the task management tool understand it easily.

##### **6. Keyboard shortcuts**

Improving the produtivity and the user experience.

##### **7. Plugins Interface**

Instead of implmenting and making PR's people could just write and realease their own plugins.

##### **8. Calendar**

Calendars are important piece of the workflow, a one place that centralize all your actions it's a really good idea.
